This game consists of 4 entities: octopus, shark, diver, and obstacle.

Octopus is the main character, and it can be moved around with the arrow keys. The sharks are supposed to chase the
octopus. The objective of the game is to not get caught by the shark. If you are caught by the shark, no worries,
the octopus will respawn in a new location, and you can keep playing.

If you wish, you can add a diver entity to the game by pressing the mouse on any square that is not occupied. The diver
helps to protect the octopus as it will chase after the shark. If the diver catches the shark, the shark will be moved
to somewhere else on the screen.

In addition to spawning the diver, a mouse press will reshuffle all of the obstacles on the screen.
